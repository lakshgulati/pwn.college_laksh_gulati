# Challenge Name
Catting Practice

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{E2y8djCVI12pq5V1TdDfiwzPjZC.QXwITO0wSOyMzNzEzW}`

```bash
Connected!
You cannot use the 'cd' command in this level, and must retrieve the flag by
absolute path. Plus, I hid the flag in a different directory! You can find it
in the file /opt/virtiofsd/flag. Go cat it out **without** cding into that
directory!
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /opt/virtiofsd/flag
pwn.college{E2y8djCVI12pq5V1TdDfiwzPjZC.QXwITO0wSOyMzNzEzW}
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$
```
