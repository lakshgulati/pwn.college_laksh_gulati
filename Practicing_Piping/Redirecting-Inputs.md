# Challenge Name
Redirecting Inputs

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8FmHaffsF0Cikz4hh3Z5XPxC0kc.QXwcTN0wSOyMzNzEzW}`

```bash
Connected!
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ echo COLLEGE > PWN
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ /challenge/run < PWN
Reading from standard input...
Correct! You have redirected the PWN file into my standard input, and I read
the value 'COLLEGE' out of it!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8FmHaffsF0Cikz4hh3Z5XPxC0kc.QXwcTN0wSOyMzNzEzW}
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$
```
